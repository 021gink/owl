	ü¶â OWL: Towards General Multi-Agent Assistant for Real-World Task Automation
</h1>

ü¶â OWL is a cutting-edge framework for multi-agent collaboration that pushes the boundaries of task automation, built on top of the [Camel-AI Framework](https://github.com/camel-ai/camel). 
OWL ranks #1 among open-source frameworks on GAIA benchmark.

Our vision is to revolutionize how AI agents collaborate to solve real-world tasks. By leveraging role-playing mechanisms and dynamic agent interactions, OWL enables more natural, efficient, and robust task automation across diverse domains.
