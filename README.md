	üêù Deep Swarm: Multi-Agent Collaboration for Task Automation in the Wild<br>
</h1>

Deep Swarm is a cutting-edge framework for multi-agent collaboration that pushes the boundaries of task automation. Built on top of the Camel Framework, Deep Swarm ranks #1 among open-source frameworks.

Our vision is to revolutionize how AI agents collaborate to solve real-world tasks. By leveraging role-playing mechanisms and dynamic agent interactions, Deep Swarm enables more natural, efficient, and robust task automation across diverse domains.

# Key Features

# Quick Start

1. **Clone the Github repository:**

```bash
$ git clone xxx
```

2. **Set up Python Environment:**

```bash
$ conda create -n deepswarm python=3.11
$ conda activate deepswarm
```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Set API Keys:** We use `dotenv` to manage API keys. Please copy and check the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the necessary API keys.

5. **Run the Demo Code:**
   
```bash
$ python run.py
```

Additionally, We have provided a script to reproduce the results in GAIA. You can check the `run_gaia_roleplaying.py` file and run the following command:

```bash
$ python run_gaia_roleplaying.py
```
